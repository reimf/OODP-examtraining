Create a class YearCalender.

Add a property Year that can be read from anywhere but only set within the class.

Add a constructor that takes a year and set the corresponding property.
Add a public field Holidays that contains a boolean for every month and day of the year
indicating whether it is a holiday or not.
Give Holidays the right amount of months, but don't add the days yet;
hint: use the right type of array.

Add a method MonthLength with a parameter month (1 <= month <= 12)
and return the number of days in that month;
hint: use your BaseCamp knowledge on leap years.
Return 0 if the month is invalid;

Add a method IsValidDay that takes a month and a day
and return whether the day is a valid day in this year.

Add a method FillHolidays that fills each month in the array Holidays
with the correct amount of days.

Add a method AddHoliday that takes a month and a day.
If it is a valid day in this year set the appropiate day to a holiday.
Return whether the day is a valid day.

Add a method IsValidHoliday that takes a month and a day.
It always returns 2 values, one named isValidDay and one named isHoliday.
If it is not a valid day, then set isHoliday to false.
Otherwise get the value isHoliday from the array of holidays.
