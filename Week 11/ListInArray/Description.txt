Note: It's not allowed to use a list anywhere in the assignment!
 
Make a class called FakeList that takes a generic.
In the class make a private array of the generic`with name Array.
Set the array directly to a new array of length 1.

Make a readonly property Capacity that returns the length of Array.

Make a property Count that represents the number of elements that are pushed to Array.
This property may be read everywhere but only written to within the class.
Remember that the default value of an int property is 0.
 
Create a method Push that takes a parameter of type T.
If Array is full,
then first create a new array with double the current capacity,
copy all existing values from Array to the new array
and assign the new array to Array.
Put the new value in the right position in Array and increase Count.
 
Create a method Peek that returns the last value of Array
or the default value of T if Array is empty.

Create a method Pop that returns the last value in Array.
This method stores the last value in Array in a temporary variable
and decreases Count.
If Array is only half full,
then create a new array of half the current capacity
and copy all values from Array to the new array
and assign the new array to Array.
Make sure the capacity is always at least 1.
Hint: also handle the case where there are no elements in Array by only returning the default value.
