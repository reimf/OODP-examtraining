Create a class PasswordChecker without fields, properties and constructors.

Add a method IsStrong that takes a string and by default returns true.

Now one by one, add the following checks to weed out weak passwords.

a. The password must not be null or empty.
b. The password must have the character 'A' in it.
c. The password must not start nor end with a white-space character.
d. The password must contain exactly 3 dashes ('-'); hint: use the Split method.
e. The password length must be at least 6.
f. The third, fourth and/or fifth character must be a '#'; hint: use the Substring method.
g. The password must contain a lowercase character; hint: use the ToUpper or ToLower method.
