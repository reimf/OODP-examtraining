Create a class Menu.

Add a readonly field Options as a dictionary to store menu options and the corresponding method that will be invoked when the option is selected.
The methods that will be invoked don't have any parameters and don't return a value.

Create a private string Descriptions to store the concatenated descriptions of all menu options.

Initialize both fields.

Create a method AddOption that takes three parameters:
* a string key representing the string that the user has to enter to invoke the corresponding action.
* a string description describing the option
* the method to invoke when the option is selected.
In the method, add the key and action to Options and concatenate the description to Descriptions, ensuring each description is on a new line.
The string that is added to Descriptions should look like "[1] Say hello".

Create a method Show that has no parameters and no return value.
In the method, enter an infinte loop.
In the loop, display Descriptions to show the menu options to the user.
Also display the string "Please choose an option and press Enter:".
Read the input from the user and check if the input is valid.
If the input is valid and the selected method is null, exit the loop.
Otherwise, invoke the corresponding method.
If the input is invalid, print the error message "Invalid option, please try again".
Hint: use the dictionary.ContainsKey method.
