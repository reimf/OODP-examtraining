Create a class WeekDay;

Add a property Name of type string that can be get and set from outside the class.

Add a property NextDay of type WeekDay that can be get and set from outside the class.
Create a custom setter that sets the NextDay property to the object itself if the value is null.
So the first WeekDay object that is created has a NextDay property that points to itself.

Sunday --+
  ^      |
  |      |
  +------+

Add a method AddNext with a string parameter that holds the name of the new WeekDay. 
First find the previous WeekDay by iterating through the NextDay properties
until you find the WeekDay that has a NextDay property that points to the current WeekDay.
Then set the value of the NextDay property to a new WeekDay object that points to the current WeekDay.

current = Sunday --> Monday --> Tuesday --+
            ^                             |
            |                             |
            +-----------------------------+
current.AddNext("Wednesday");
current == Sunday --> Monday --> Tuesday --> Wednesday --+
             ^                                           |
             |                                           |
             +-------------------------------------------+


Create a recursive method ForAll that has 2 parameters (a function that has no parameters and no return value, and a parameter endDay) and no return value.
Recursively apply the function to all the WeekDay objects until you reach the endDay.
