Copy the file TemplateSpeaker.cs to Speaker.cs and rename the class to Speaker.

The method Speak should return the correct pronounciation of the number in Dutch.
So if the number is 12, then the method should return "twaalf".

Currently the method Speak always returns "onbekend".

Step 1: enhance the implementation of the method Speak so that it returns the correct pronounciation of the number if the number is contained in the dictionary Base, otherwise return "onbekend".
Hint: use the method ContainsKey() on the dictionary Base.

Step 2: enhance the implementation of the method Speak so that it also returns the correct pronounciation of the numbers 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90.
Hint 1: use recursion, so in pronouncing 50, use the fact that Speak already knows how to pronounce 5 and add "tig" .
Hint 2: if hint 1 doesn't apply (e.g. for 20), add it to the dictionary Base.

Step 3: enhance the implementation of the method Speak such that all numbers from 1 to 99 are pronounced correctly.
Hint: use recursion, so in pronouncing 64, use the fact that Speak already knows how to pronounce 4 ("vier"), and 60 ("zestig") and add these together with "en" in between.

Step 4 (OPTIONAL): copy the body of the method Speak over the body of the method Speak.
Enhance the implementation of the method Speak such that all numbers from 1 to 999 are pronounced correctly.

Step 5 (OPTIONAL): enhance the implementation of the method Speak such that all numbers from 1 to 999_999 are pronounced correctly.
