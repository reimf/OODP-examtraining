Create a class Person with 4 properties that can only be set in the class and not read outside of the class.
Call them Name, YearOfBirth, Mother and Father.
Mother and Father are of type Person.

Add a constructor that takes 4 parameters (name, year, mother, father) in the order provided
and set the values of the properties accordingly.

Override the ToString() method in the class to return a string in the following format:
"Name (child of Mother and Father)" if the person has 2 known parents,
"Name (child of ...)" if the person has only 1 known parent, or
"Name" if the person has no known parents.
So if someone only has a known mother with 2 known grandparents, the string should be:
"Name (child of Mother (child of Grandmother and Grandfather))"
Hint 1: use recursion.
Hint 2: create a list of strings parentNames to store the names of known parents.
Hint 3: use string.Join(" and ", parentNames) to create the string with the name(s) of the parent(s).

Add a method AncestorsBornAfter(int year) that returns a list of all ancestors (including the person itself) born after the given year.
Hint 1: use recursion.
Hint 2: you can add all elements of a list to another list with the list.AddRange(otherList) method.
