Create a generic class ArrayPrinter that works on type T.

Add a field Array that is an array of type T.
This field may only be set in the constructor and is not readable from outside the class.

Add a constructor that has an array of type T as parameter and set the corresponding field.

Add a method WriteUsingForeach that writes the elements of Array separated with a space.
So if Array is an array containing strings "a", "b" and "c" then this method will write "a b c".
Use a foreach loop.

Add a method WriteUsingRecursion that writes the element of Array separated with a space.
This method has a parameter index that indicates where to start writing the array.
Use recursion.
Hint: what is the easiest array to write? how can you write a small part followed by the rest?

Add a method ConcatUsingForeach that returns a string containing the elements of Array separated with a space.

Add a method ConcatUsingRecursion that returns a string containing the elements of Array separated with a space.
This method also has a parameter index that indicates where to start concatting.
Use recursion.
