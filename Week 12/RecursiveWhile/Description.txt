Study the class OneTimeReader in TemplateOneTimeReader.cs.
As you can see, an OneTimeReader is initialized with an array of strings
and the only method is ReadNext.
The first call to ReadNext returns the first string in the array,
the second call the second, and so on.
When all the strings are returned, the method returns null for all subsequent calls.

Create a static class LengthCounter.

Add a method LengthUsingWhile that takes an OneTimeReader as parameter.
The method should returns the number of string in a OneTimeReader using a while loop.

Add a method LengthUsingRecursion that takes an OneTimeReader as parameter.
The method should returns the number of string in a OneTimeReader using recursion.
