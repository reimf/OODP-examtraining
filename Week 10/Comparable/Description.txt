Create a class Employee.

Add properties FirstName and LastName that can be read and set anywhere.
Setting the first name to a name that is less than 3 characters
should add a question mark at the end.
So setting it to "Bo" should set the first name equal to "Bo?".
The last name should be "Onbekend" if it is set to the empty string.

Add a constructor that accepts the two name parts as parameters
and set the corresponding properties.

Override the method ToString to produce the full name.

Implement the interface IComparable by comparing two employees on their last name
and if the last name is the same, then on first name.
